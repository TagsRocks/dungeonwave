# Description

A Godot game I did over the weekend to demonstrate how you can create custom modules and tie those into NavigationMeshes.

Includes my DungeonMap and DungeonMapDebugRenderer custom nodes.

# Requirements

**Requires you to build your own CUSTOM version of Godot with the dungeonmap module.**
